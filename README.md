# REINFORCE-algorithm-of-policy-gradient
This notebook presents an implementation of the REINFORCE algorithm for policy gradient learning, applied to solve the Cartpole problem from the Gym library. The Cartpole problem involves balancing a pole on a cart by applying left or right forces to the cart. We utilize neural networks to model and modify the probabilities taken by the policy, enhancing the agent's decision-making process.

Furthermore, we explore the concept of parallel learning to address correlated similar states efficiently. This approach aids in implementing stochastic gradient ascent methods effectively. Additionally, we incorporate the notion of information entropy (H) to improve the robustness of the algorithm. By adjusting the policy's exploration-exploitation trade-off using entropy, we aim to achieve more stable and adaptive learning in dynamic environments. This notebook provides insights into the implementation details and experimental results of the REINFORCE algorithm with these enhancements for solving the Cartpole problem.
